Coursera course 'Getting and Cleaning Data' project.

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis

This submission includes:
- a tidy data set
- script for performing the analysis
- a code book that describes the variables, the data, and transformations performed to clean up the data


Data source

"One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone."

Data Analysis

The script run_analysis.R meets the course project requirements:
- Load and merge training and tests datasets.
- Calculate mean and standard deviation 
- Set a descriptive name for each field
- create a second, independent tidy data
